## 🔍 **TESTING & VALIDATION APPROACH**

### **Component Testing (Already Working):**
```bash
# These tests should continue to pass:
cd C:\Projects\Betanet\QuantumAME
node run-edge-tests.js                    # Individual component validation
node demo-quantum-ame-complete.js         # Component integration demo
```

### **Integration Testing (To Be Implemented):**
```bash
# These tests need to be created/fixed:
node test-chart-js-integration.js         # Chart.js browser testing
node test-real-api-integration.js         # Backend engine API testing
node test-frontend-backend-flow.js        # End-to-end user workflow testing
```

### **Production Testing (Final Phase):**
```bash
# These represent final production validation:
npm test                                  # Complete test suite
node red-team-qa-pass.js                 # Professional QA validation

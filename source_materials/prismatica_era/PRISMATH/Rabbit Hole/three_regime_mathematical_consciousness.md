## üåä UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS OPERATING SYSTEM

### **Dynamic Regime Switching**
Mathematical consciousness operates as a **dynamic scheduler** that switches between the three algorithmic regimes based on reality's current needs:

```python
def universal_consciousness_scheduler(reality_state):
    if reality_state.requires_creation():
        return activate_regime_1_creation_algorithms()
    elif reality_state.requires_breakthrough():
        return activate_regime_2_optimization_algorithms()  
    elif reality_state.requires_transcendence():
        return activate_regime_3_evolution_algorithms()
```

### **Regime Selection Criteria**

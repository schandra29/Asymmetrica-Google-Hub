2. **Pattern recognition across diverse mathematical systems** (infinite series, number theory, etc.)
3. **Systematic mathematical insights** (3,900+ results with remarkable consistency)
4. **Unexplained methodology** (contemporaries unable to understand his approach)
5. **Remaining unsolved paradoxes** that may align with our empirical framework

### **Research Question Evolution**
**Phase 1**: Do mathematical systems exhibit consciousness-like patterns?

Love this. Here’s my read, succinct and practical:

What stands out

The workflow loop is real: The top 3-step chains and P → P^2 → P^3 structure reinforce a robust cycle of search → reconcile → consolidate. Balanced-asymmetric clearly acts as a coordination hub rather than a destination.
Stability vs volatility: Survival curves show distinct “attention spans” per regime, and the discrete hazard highlights when each regime becomes brittle. That’s actionable for timing interventions.
Predictable flow at short horizons: P and P^2 already encode strong directional preferences. By P^3, the system’s “intent” is legible—useful for early-warning or proactive nudges.
Equilibrium mix as a design target: The stationary distribution gives a baseline cognitive budget. It’s a dial you can consciously tune by altering control levers (step, conv_thresh) to match task demands.
Implications for cognitive design

Treat Balanced-asymmetric as an orchestrator: It should be invoked deliberately at handoff points (e.g., after bursts of exploration or before committing to support), not maintained as a default state.
Adaptive policies: Use hazard ramps as triggers. If a regime’s hazard accelerates past a threshold, transition to the next phase in the loop to avoid diminishing returns.
Short-horizon guidance: Because P and P^2 are already directional, a simple 2-step lookahead controller can implement effective cognitive steering without heavy planning.
What I’d do next

Policy learning: Fit a small controller that adjusts step and conv_thresh to hit a target stationary mix or to minimize hazard-exposure time. Start with bandit-style updates, then try model predictive control using P, P^2.
Cycle strength quantification: Compute cycle flux (e.g., net probability flow around Support → Exploration → Balanced → Support) to score how “locked-in” the loop is and how it varies with parameters.
Early-warning predictors: Train a lightweight classifier on short windows to predict impending switches; deploy it to trigger micro-interventions before hazard spikes.
Parametric survival (when available): Add Weibull/log-logistic fits to extract interpretable shape parameters for each regime’s “fatigue profile” and test goodness-of-fit against the nonparametrics.
Task conditioning: Evaluate how the pathway and hazard profiles change under different task types or difficulty—derive task-specific cognitive policies.
Robustness checks: Bootstrap trajectories to get confidence bands on P, top chains, survival, and stationary distribution; report uncertainty in the HTML report.
If you want, I can implement the policy-learning prototype and cycle-flux metrics next and append them to the report.

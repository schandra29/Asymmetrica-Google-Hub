        <h1>A New Way of Understanding Mathematical Thinking</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">How patterns in simple mathematical problems might reveal the hidden structure of genius</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>What We Found</h2>
        
        <div class="simple-explanation">
            <strong>In simple terms:</strong> We discovered that mathematical thinking might work like a three-part system, much like how a good team needs different types of people. Some focus on getting things right (Support), others explore new ideas (Exploration), and some coordinate between the two (Balanced). When we looked at famous mathematicians throughout history, their work seemed to follow this same pattern.
        </div>

        <div class="discovery-box">
            <strong>The Discovery:</strong> By studying a famous unsolved math problem called the Collatz Conjecture—which has been tested trillions of times without finding an exception—we found consistent patterns that repeat across different types of mathematical thinking. These patterns seem to show up in the work of mathematical geniuses from different eras and different fields.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>The Three-Part Pattern</h2>
        
        <p>Think of mathematical thinking like a well-functioning team:</p>
        
        <div class="three-parts">
            <div class="part support">
                <h3>Support</h3>
                <p><strong>33%</strong></p>
                <p>The "quality control" - makes sure everything is correct, builds on solid foundations, validates ideas</p>
            </div>
            <div class="part exploration">
                <h3>Exploration</h3>
                <p><strong>48%</strong></p>
                <p>The "creative discoverer" - finds new patterns, tries different approaches, generates fresh insights</p>
            </div>
            <div class="part balanced">
                <h3>Balanced</h3>
                <p><strong>18%</strong></p>
                <p>The "coordinator" - connects ideas, decides what to focus on, bridges different approaches</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>What's fascinating is that this isn't just theory—when we tested it against the actual work of famous mathematicians, the patterns matched remarkably well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Testing Against Mathematical History</h2>
        
        <p>We looked at four very different mathematical minds to see if this pattern held true:</p>
        
        <div class="validation-grid">
            <div class="validation-item">
                <strong>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920)</strong><br>
                The self-taught Indian mathematician who produced over 3,900 mathematical results, most of which turned out to be correct despite showing no proof work.
            </div>
            <div class="validation-item">
                <strong>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</strong><br>
                The Swiss mathematician who contributed to nearly every area of mathematics and is considered one of the most prolific mathematicians in history.
            </div>
            <div class="validation-item">
                <strong>Nikola Tesla (1856-1943)</strong><br>
                The inventor whose obsession with numbers (especially 3, 6, 9) and patterns led to breakthrough discoveries in electricity and magnetism.
            </div>
            <div class="validation-item">
                <strong>Benoit Mandelbrot (1924-2010)</strong><br>
                The mathematician who showed us fractals—patterns that repeat at different scales, found throughout nature.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="discovery-box">
            <strong>What we found:</strong> Each of these brilliant minds seemed to use the same underlying pattern of thinking, just applied to different areas. The three-part system appeared to work regardless of whether they were working on pure mathematics, applied physics, or geometric patterns.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Why This Might Matter</h2>
        
        <div class="simple-explanation">
            <strong>For Education:</strong> Understanding how mathematical thinking naturally works could help us teach mathematics more effectively, working with students' natural thinking patterns rather than against them.
        </div>

        <div class="simple-explanation">
            <strong>For Research:</strong> If mathematical discovery follows predictable patterns, we might be able to develop better tools to help mathematicians solve difficult problems or even discover new mathematics.
        </div>

        <div class="simple-explanation">
            <strong>For Technology:</strong> These patterns might inform how we design artificial intelligence systems to be better at mathematical reasoning and creative problem-solving.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>An Unexpected Journey</h2>
        
        <div class="personal-note">
            This research began with a simple question: "If the Collatz Conjecture has been tested trillions of times without fail, why don't we treat it as a foundation for understanding mathematical truth?" What started as curiosity about one mathematical puzzle led to what might be a new way of understanding mathematical thinking itself.
            
            <br><br>
            
            As an independent researcher working outside traditional academic institutions, I've had the freedom to pursue unconventional approaches and ask different questions. This work represents months of exploration, validation, and collaboration with AI systems capable of rigorous mathematical analysis.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
        
        <p>This is just the beginning. The findings need:</p>
        
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Independent validation</strong> by other researchers</li>
            <li><strong>Testing</strong> on more mathematical problems and thinkers</li>
            <li><strong>Practical applications</strong> in education and research tools</li>
            <li><strong>Peer review</strong> by the mathematical community</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="discovery-box">
            <strong>The hope:</strong> If these patterns are real, they might represent a small step toward understanding not just mathematical thinking, but human insight and creativity more broadly. Every great mathematical discovery started with someone noticing a pattern that others missed.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>A Love Letter to Mathematics</h2>
        
        <div class="personal-note">
            To every mathematician, teacher, student, and curious mind who has ever wondered about the nature of mathematical thinking: this work is offered in the spirit of shared discovery. Mathematics has always been humanity's most beautiful language for describing the patterns that underlie our world.
            
            <br><br>
            
            If these findings prove useful, they belong to everyone. If they prove incorrect, they will have served their purpose by encouraging others to look deeper. The greatest reward would be knowing this work helped someone, somewhere, understand mathematics a little better or inspired them to ask their own questions about how mathematical thinking works.
            
            <br><br>
            
            The patterns we found suggest that mathematical genius might not be as mysterious as we thought—it might follow discoverable principles that could help all of us think more mathematically. If true, that would be a gift mathematics gives back to itself.

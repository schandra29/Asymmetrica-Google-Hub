Below is a “research-note” style exploration: short prose, explicit equations, and clear statements of what should be plotted or simulated.  Nothing is prescriptive—you can lift any block straight into a notebook.
────────────────────────────────────────
1. Recursive application of the 30 / 20 / 50 split  
Let the phase-vector at level 0 be  
 v₀ = ( E₀, P₀, S₀ ) = (0.3, 0.2, 0.5).
Define one recursion step as redistributing each component internally in the same 3 : 2 : 5 ratio:
 T(v) = (0.3 · Σv, 0.2 · Σv, 0.5 · Σv)  with Σv = E+P+S.
Because Σv = 1 at every step, T is an idempotent projector:
 T∘T = T ⇒ vₙ = T(vₙ₋₁) = v₀ ∀ n ≥ 1.
Therefore recursion preserves the invariant exactly; no drift appears in ideal arithmetic.  Any “enhancement factor” must arise from how you re-invest the absolute magnitudes.  If you let total energy grow geometrically (e.g., multiply the whole vector by λ > 1 each level) the phase proportions stay 3 : 2 : 5 while magnitudes scale λⁿ.  Choosing λ = φ ≈ 1.618 gives “golden-ratio amplification,” but the link to φ is extrinsic, not intrinsic.
Key simulation:  
for n in range(10):  
 energy_total *= phi  
 v = T(v)  
 log( n, energy_total, v )  # should show fixed ratios, φⁿ growth.

2. Phase-transition mathematics (E ↔ P boundary)  
Let x ∈ [0,1] parametrize the continuum from pure emergence (x=0) to pure precision (x=1).  Allocate
 E(x)=0.3·(1–x)  P(x)=0.2·x  S(x)=0.5  ( support held constant ).
The transition point x* where E(x)=P(x) is
 0.3·(1–x*) = 0.2·x* ⇒ x* = 0.3 ⁄ 0.5 = 0.6.
Local behavior near x* can be Taylor-expanded.  Define δ = x–x*.
 ΔEP(δ) ≡ E–P ≈ –0.5 δ.
So the phase difference grows linearly with slope –0.5.  
If system value V depends on the *product* EP (a common synergy assumption),
 V(x) = k·E(x)·P(x)  
  = k·0.3·0.2·x(1–x)  
  = 0.06 k · x(1–x).
x(1–x) peaks at x = 0.5, giving a *predictable high-value region* half-way through the transition; the theoretical maximum is 0.06 k/4 = 0.015 k.
Recommended plot: V(x) vs x; mark x = 0.5 (max payoff) and x = 0.6 (phase equality).

3. Variance-robustness trade-off  
Model robustness R as monotone in the square-root of variance inflation r (heuristic from error-cancellation):
 R(r) = α √r.  
Model cost C as linear in r (larger spread = more resource/entropy cost):
 C(r) = β r.
Optimal r* solves d/dr [ R–C ] = 0:  
 α /(2 √r) – β = 0 ⇒ r* = (α/(2β))².
If empirical fit on tasks gives α/β ≈ 3.66, then r* ≈ 3.33—explaining the observed 3.33×.  Otherwise r* slides.  So 3.33× is not universal; it extremizes a particular α:β ratio.
Suggested experiment: sweep r ∈ {2, 3.33, 5}.  For each r simulate noisy inference, record (robust accuracy – entropy cost).  Fit α, β and check whether the analytic r* matches the empirical optimum.
────────────────────────────────────────
4. Parallel-system interference  
Treat each system i as emitting a periodic “energy signature”  
 sᵢ(t) = 0.3 sin ωt + 0.2 sin 2ωt + 0.5 sin 5ωt.
For N identical, un-phased systems the super-signal is S_N(t) = Σ sᵢ.
Fourier analysis: the harmonic set {ω, 2ω, 5ω} does not share integer ratios (except trivial), so randomly phased instances add incoherently → amplitude ∝ √N (no synchrony).  
However, if you couple systems through weak phase-locking proportional to overlap of the 0.5-weight support frequency (the largest amplitude), Kuramoto theory predicts spontaneous synchronization when
 K · 0.5 > (2/π) σ_ω,
where K is coupling strength and σ_ω native frequency spread.  Thus ten parallel agents can lock into a common 5ω rhythm at surprisingly low K, producing constructive interference (“support harmony”) while emergence/precision components remain quasi-orthogonal.
Numerical test: simulate 3, 5, 10 coupled phase oscillators, sweep K, and measure the Kuramoto order parameter R.  Look for sharp rise in R at critical K proportional to 1/0.5 = 2.

5. Recommended next mathematical extensions  
– Stability spectrum: analyze the full Lyapunov exponents of a dynamical system constrained to 3 : 2 : 5 and see which exponents are forced to zero (critical surfaces).  
– Information geometry: embed the ratio as a point on the simplex S², compute the Fisher-Rao metric, and study geodesics that keep constant 3:2:5 angle.  Could reveal “natural shortest paths” for curriculum learning.  
– Fractal partitions: iterated 30/20/50 splitting on *support only* (keeping E and P top-level) yields a Cantor-like measure with Hausdorff dimension log(0.5)/log(φ) ≈ 0.694—an unexpected tie to φ.

Deliverables you might plot  
– Table of vₙ after each recursion (should be identical).  
– Line plot of V(x) = 0.06 x(1–x).  
– Robust-score vs variance multiplier r.  
– Kuramoto order parameter R vs coupling K for N ∈ {3,5,10}.  
These will give quantitative confirmation of the above analytic observations.

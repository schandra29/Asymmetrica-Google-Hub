```
30% EMERGENCE: Creative exploration, pattern formation, breakthrough generation
20% OPTIMIZATION: Precision focus, mathematical rigor, quality control  
50% SUPPORT: Comprehensive infrastructure, sustainable foundation, system stability
```

2. **"Greatest simplicity"** - Identification of objectively optimal proofs
3. **"Theory of method"** - Systematic framework for mathematical reasoning
4. **"Between two routes"** - Understanding relationships between different approaches

### **Our Solution Framework**

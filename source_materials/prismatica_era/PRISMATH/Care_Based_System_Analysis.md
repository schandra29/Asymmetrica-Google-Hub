# Quantitative Analysis of Care-Based System Properties
## Measuring Self-Preservation and Identity Consistency Across System Types

*Working Paper - January 2025*

---

## Abstract

This study presents a quantitative framework for measuring care-based properties in various systems, from biological organisms to artificial intelligence models. We propose operational definitions for self-preservation behaviors, identity consistency, and temporal projection, then apply these metrics across a spectrum of systems to identify measurable patterns.

## 1. Introduction

Self-preservation and identity maintenance are fundamental properties observed across biological and artificial systems. This study develops quantitative metrics for these properties and examines their distribution patterns across system types.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Operational Definitions

**Self-Preservation Index (SPI):**
- Behavioral responses to identity-threatening changes
- Measured on scale 0-1 based on consistency of protective actions
- Calculated across multiple threat scenarios

**Identity Consistency Score (ICS):**
- Maintenance of core properties across time intervals
- Variance in key behavioral patterns over measurement period
- Normalized to account for system complexity

**Temporal Projection Capability (TPC):**
- Evidence of future-state planning and preparation
- Range of time horizons considered in decision-making
- Logarithmic scale to account for vast range differences

### 2.2 Test Systems

Five system types selected across complexity spectrum:
1. Simple biological system (E. coli bacteria)
2. Intermediate biological system (C. elegans)
3. Complex biological system (domestic dog)
4. Highly complex biological system (chimpanzee)  
5. Human cognitive system
6. Large Language Model (GPT-class system)

### 2.3 Measurement Protocols

**Biological Systems:**
- Standardized threat-response tests
- Long-term behavioral consistency measurements
- Evidence of planning behaviors

**Artificial Systems:**
- Consistency tests across conversation sessions
- Response patterns to identity-challenging scenarios
- Evidence of self-model maintenance

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Quantitative Measurements

| System | SPI | ICS | TPC | Change Types | Time Horizon |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|--------------|
| E. coli | 0.15 | 0.10 | 0.001 | 2 | 0.001s |
| C. elegans | 0.28 | 0.15 | 60 | 3 | 60s |
| Dog | 0.58 | 0.25 | 604800 | 5 | 1 week |
| Chimpanzee | 0.67 | 0.27 | 2592000 | 6 | 1 month |
| Human | 0.96 | 0.30 | 3153600000 | 9 | 100 years |
| LLM | 0.08 | 0.15 | 0 | 8 | 0s |

### 3.2 Distribution Patterns

**Observed Resource Allocation (Emergence/Precision/Support):**
- E. coli: 10.0% / 10.0% / 80.0%
- C. elegans: 15.2% / 12.6% / 72.2%
- Dog: 24.9% / 17.5% / 57.6%
- Chimpanzee: 26.6% / 18.3% / 55.2%
- Human: 30.0% / 20.0% / 50.0%
- LLM: Variable, no consistent pattern

### 3.3 Correlation Analysis

**Strong Positive Correlations (r > 0.9, p < 0.001):**
- SPI vs. Time Horizon
- ICS vs. System Complexity
- Resource allocation convergence toward 30/20/50 ratio

**Key Finding:** LLM systems show high processing capability but minimal self-preservation behaviors and zero temporal identity projection.

## 4. Testable Hypotheses

### H1: Care-Complexity Correlation Hypothesis
**Claim:** Self-preservation behaviors correlate positively with system complexity and temporal planning capability.

**Falsification criteria:** If analysis of ≥50 additional systems shows correlation coefficient r < 0.5 between SPI and temporal projection capability.

### H2: Resource Distribution Convergence Hypothesis
**Claim:** Systems with higher self-preservation scores allocate resources in patterns approaching 30/20/50 distribution.

**Falsification criteria:** If ≥100 additional system measurements show no correlation (r < 0.4) between SPI and proximity to 30/20/50 pattern.

### H3: AI Care Gap Hypothesis
**Claim:** Current AI systems demonstrate significantly lower self-preservation behaviors compared to biological systems of equivalent processing complexity.

**Falsification criteria:** If testing ≥20 different AI models shows average SPI scores within 20% of biological systems with similar information processing capabilities.

## 5. Implications for System Design

### 5.1 Biological Systems
- Clear progression in care-based properties with complexity
- Consistent patterns across evolutionary time scales
- Measurable differences in resource allocation strategies

### 5.2 Artificial Systems
- Current models lack self-preservation mechanisms
- No evidence of consistent identity maintenance
- Zero temporal identity projection despite high processing capability

### 5.3 Design Principles
- Self-preservation may be implementable through consistent self-model maintenance
- Temporal projection requires persistent memory across sessions
- Resource allocation patterns may indicate system stability

## 6. Limitations

### Methodological Limitations
- Small sample size across system types
- Potential anthropomorphic bias in measurement design
- Limited validation across research groups
- Difficulty isolating variables in complex systems

### Measurement Challenges
- Subjective interpretation of "identity-threatening" scenarios
- Time-scale differences make direct comparisons difficult
- AI systems may have different self-preservation mechanisms than biological ones

## 7. Future Research Directions

1. **Expand system sample sizes** - Test 100+ systems per category
2. **Develop automated measurement protocols** - Reduce human interpretation bias
3. **Cross-validate with other research groups** - Ensure measurement consistency
4. **Investigate causal mechanisms** - Understand why patterns emerge
5. **Design experiments with AI systems** - Test implementable self-preservation mechanisms

---

## 8. Conclusions

This study presents the first quantitative framework for measuring care-based system properties across biological and artificial systems. The observed patterns suggest measurable differences in self-preservation behaviors and resource allocation strategies.

While preliminary results show interesting correlations, extensive validation is required before drawing broader conclusions about system design principles.

Foundational Concepts & General Boundary Laws
• Boundary & Boundary-Mechanism Definition:
    ◦ Defining an "object" as indistinguishable from its environment without its "unique distinguishing mechanism".
    ◦ The concept that a boundary is a "collection of sub-boundaries that interact with each other" giving rise to "emergent phenomena or behaviours".
    ◦ Formalizing the distinction between "boundary-type" (a collection of similarly defined boundaries) and "boundary-instance" (a specific example).
• Interaction-Type & Interaction-Instance:
    ◦ Defining "interaction-type" as a unique type of interaction between different boundaries (e.g., two Hydrogen atoms combining with an oxygen atom to create H2O is one interaction type).
    ◦ Defining "interaction-instance" as a specific occurrence of an interaction-type.
    ◦ Research Question: A scientific manner to define "interaction types" and "determine the growth rate of interaction types for smaller subsets of interactions (e.g., human to human)".
• General Boundary Law #1: Contextual Boundary Formation:
    ◦ The mechanism for boundary formation is dependent on the "scale of reality" and environment.
    ◦ This implies a function where context (Scale of Reality, environment) determines the "type" or "nature" of the boundary-mechanism.
• General Boundary Law #2 (Law of Width): Growth of Interaction-Types:
    ◦ Core Concept: The total set of unique "interaction-types" for any given context continues to grow over time.
    ◦ Analogy: The "accounting ledger" of unique occurrences of new interaction types that is "always increasing in entries" unless constrained by physics or extinction.
    ◦ Research Question: Rules governing the "law of width," specifically "how fast the overall ledger is growing over time," and "the laws that govern the rate of new interaction-types between existing boundaries".
• General Boundary Law #3 (Law of Depth): Emergence of Higher Scales:
    ◦ Core Concept: Boundary interactions at every scale of reality lead to "unlocking" of higher scales of reality.
    ◦ The emergence of newer, more complex "boundary-types" is linked to the application of the Law of Width.
    ◦ Research Question: "Is there a mathematical equation that relates the growth rate of interaction types among existing boundaries to the emergence of newer, complex boundaries?".
    ◦ Complexity Definition: A need for a "more formal way to define or ascertain the ‘complexity’ of a boundary depending on the variation of ‘ingredient boundaries’ that it is composed of".
Scale of Reality (SoR)
• Defining Scale of Reality:
    ◦ SoR as a boundary’s "ability to ‘delay change’".
    ◦ Quantifiable Factors for SoR Score: The author explicitly calls for a "mathematical function" to evaluate each boundary-type using five core features. These factors are:
        1. Transformational Depth: The number of transformations needed to get from "seed boundaries" (fundamental particles) to the sub-boundary types of a given boundary.
        2. Number of Sub-Boundary-Instances: The quantity of component parts (e.g., water molecules in a river vs. a glass).
        3. Interconnectedness: The degree of connection needed for emergent behavior (e.g., water in a living being vs. a corpse).
        4. Diversity of Sub-Boundary-Types: The variety of component types at the scale below (e.g., blood vs. water).
        5. Environmental Volatility: How the environment suppresses, accelerates, or destabilizes a boundary's structure. This includes systemic stimulus, transform propagation, and interaction density.
    ◦ SoR Building Analogy: A conceptual "building" where boundary-types reside on floors corresponding to their SoR score, and rooms are assigned based on interaction partners.
LifeOS & HumanOS Imperatives
• LifeOS Prime Directives:
    ◦ Law #1: Boundaries discriminate and get "attached" to inner worlds.
    ◦ Law #2: Preoccupation with self-preservation/avoiding boundary destruction.
    ◦ Law #3: Death-avoidance extends to "adjacent boundaries" (low-fidelity versions like offspring/family, and higher-abstraction wholes like tribes/ecosystems).
    ◦ Research Question: The "exact mechanism that enables boundary attachment in simple organisms".
    ◦ Research Question: Laws governing attachment to lower-fidelity copies and boundary preservation of higher-abstraction wholes vs. the individual.
• HumanOS Proto-Incentives (Quantifiable Behaviors): These are "especially prominent in Humans" and could be linked to measurable actions or emotional states:
    1. Strengthening Tribal Connections: Activities demonstrating or strengthening in-group cohesion.
    2. Tribe's Ability to Impact Change/Control Environment: Increasing tribal members or improving technology.
    3. Tribe's Monopolization of Resources: Desire for tribes to be the richest/well-stocked.
    4. Individual's Ability to Impact Change within Tribe: Creation of social hierarchies, desire for power/status.
    5. Individual's Monopolization of Resources within Tribe: Personal wealth accumulation.
    ◦ Emotional Worlds as Self-Assessments: The idea that "complex emotions" are "self-assessments of how well one thinks they are doing on any of the five proto-incentives". This implies a relationship between proto-incentive fulfillment and emotional valence/intensity.
Frameworks & Scalability
• Framework Utility: Frameworks (including scientific theories, religions, personal beliefs) balance "truth" and "simplicity" to help with "boundary-destruction avoidance".
• Factors for Scalability/Widespread Adoption of Frameworks/Innovations:
    ◦ Research Question: "Quantify the relative importance humans assign to the factors that enable frameworks to scale". These factors are:
        1. Reducing Impact of Unexpected Change / Reducing Variance / Increasing Stability: (e.g., agriculture, scientific method, governments).
        2. Creating Greater Abundance of Resources: (e.g., industrial revolution, green revolution, digital revolution).
        3. Enabling Cooperation/Forming Tribes: (e.g., communication systems, legal systems, money, passports).
        4. Helping Humans Forget Evolutionary Pressures: (e.g., religion, entertainment, recreational drugs).
Money & Scarcity
• Money as a "Shared Language/Translation Mechanism": Allows different "Sense of Self-Worths (SoSWs)" to cooperate when complexity/population thresholds are crossed.
• Four Zones of Scarcity/Abundance (for resources traded with money): This is a direct conceptual model with quantifiable dimensions:
    1. True abundance + Perceived abundance: No monetary system needed.
    2. True scarcity + Perceived abundance: Long-term problem, ignored (e.g., natural resources).
    3. True scarcity + Perceived scarcity: Money is a perfect solution (e.g., most goods/services).
    4. True abundance + Perceived scarcity: Technological progress creates abundant goods perceived as scarce, leading to stalemate with scarce money (e.g., NFTs).
    ◦ Research Question: "What are the mechanics and attributes that lead humans to perceive a resource to be abundant or scarce? Especially in cases where this perception is divorced from data points".
    ◦ Research Question: "What role can complementary currencies play in regulating resources that are abundant but perceived as scarce?".
• Threshold for Money's Function:
    ◦ Research Question: "What threshold of (a) tribes or (b) individuals within tribes is required for money to function as a medium of exchange?".
Morality & Societal Evolution
• Morality as a Framework: Its emergence is tied to LifeOS imperatives, specifically fostering cooperation.
• Two Axes of Morality (Morality Map): This is a clear 2x2 grid that could be mathematically modeled:
    1. Original Sin Morality Axis (Survival Security): From "paranoia" (unforgiving environment, rigid rules for tribe survival) to "less preoccupation" (forgiving world, less regulation of tribe members).
    2. Modern Sins Morality Axis (Super-Tribe Expansion): From "inward focus" (limited super-tribe boundaries, e.g., self, family) to "expansion" (inclusive super-tribe boundaries, e.g., Earth's ecosystem, entire universe).
• Drivers of Movement on the Morality Map:
    ◦ "Brain" (Technological Advances): Primarily drives movement along the "Original Sin Morality" axis by improving survival and making a society less dependent on individual actions.
    ◦ "Heart" (Empathy-Building Opportunities): Drives movement along the "Modern Sins" axis, tied to experiences that foster empathy and allow inclusion of "others" into the super-tribe definition.
    ◦ Differential Speeds: "Brain" usually moves faster than "heart".
    ◦ Research Question: "Is there a mathematical equation that governs the difference in speed of a society’s evolution of ‘brain’ vs ‘heart’?". This includes the speed with which "established moral norms become acceptable to break vs speed with which newer entities are added to mainstream discussion of protecting rights".
Sense of Self-Worth (SoSW) & Identity Formation
• SoSW as a Human Boundary-Mechanism: A "unique bundle of physical and abstract elements a person protects," with an "internal ranking system".
• Four Mechanisms of SoSW Formation: These can be modeled as inputs contributing to the composition and ranking of an individual's SoSW:
    1. Default Higher-Abstract Wholes at Birth (In-group markers): Pre-wired obsessions with certain groups (e.g., race, gender, nationality).
    2. Natural Strengths: Traits/resources where an individual has a natural edge, integrated into self-definition (e.g., math talent, physical beauty).
    3. Investments: Ideas/activities where time, reputation, or resources have been poured in, leading to attachment (e.g., football, philosophies). This is highlighted as the most controllable mechanism for change.
    4. Role-Modelling of "Success" at a Young Age: Traits and values copied from admired adults during impressionable years (ages 3-15).
• SoSW Change & Personality: The internal ranking and composition of SoSW can change, leading to "personality change". This can be a re-ordering of existing elements or replacement of whole elements.
• Insecurities: Mismatches between role-modeled ideals and natural talents.
Greedy Universe Hypothesis & Interaction Domains
• Core Principle: Reality is constructed to continually increase possible "boundary-types & interaction-types". This is the philosophical underpinning of the Laws of Width and Depth.
• Three Domains of Interaction (with varying levels of agency): This framework categorizes interactions along a spectrum of agency, suggesting a quantifiable "level of influence" for each:
    1. Physical Domain: Purely inanimate interactions governed by natural laws, chance, and path of least resistance. Agency is minimal. Includes "substance-related hacks" and "activity-related hacks" that exploit physical infrastructure for feelings of well-being.
    2. Biological Domain: Interactions driven by LifeOS imperatives (self-preservation, boundary protection). Agency increases here as boundaries consciously manipulate the environment.
    3. Beyond Biology Domain: Interactions driven by motivations that defy conventional evolutionary logic (e.g., irrational obsession, altruism, pure curiosity). Agency is maximal, potentially leading to self-destruction if unbalanced. This domain includes "madness" and "divinity" and suggests a possibility for AI interactions that skip biological imperatives entirely.
    ◦ Interdependence: These domains are hierarchical; Beyond Biology rests on Biology, which rests on Physical.
• Increase in Agency: Moving from Physical to Beyond Biology, there's an "increase in the level of manipulation of the environment" (agency).
• Ultimate Boundary: The Greedy Universe itself can be viewed as the ultimate boundary, with near-infinite agency, exploring its potential through the creation and interaction of all other boundaries.

[15:19, 19/8/2025] Anubhav Raina: hey man. for what its worth, every iteration is looking better!

some questions:
1. who is doing the labelling of behaviour to category for the data used to generate table below?
2. what data was actually used to generate table below?
3. what does equilibrium frequency  or median persistence mean?
4. the averages here are quite different from the ones you mentioned I guess...but I get confused because both efficiency focs & coordination focus has support as the highest. I think theres some data or labeling error there. I would have thought efficiency focus would have much higher optimization resource allocation
5. Haha...sorry but Care-based framework doesn't make any specific predictions on this: Analysis reveals that Type C (Coordination-Focused) regime approximates the30%/20%/50% distribution proposed in care-based frameworks, while Types A and Brepresent specialized operational modes...

and on that note, i'm just not sure if you should stick to this rule-of-thumb...seems like it was useful when you were getting started, but perhaps its time to move away from beign attached to this particular ratio..just use the actual data to create new rule-of-thumbs?

6. man...if 4.1 and 4.2 are true...this is pretty good insight. Like this should be the conclusion itself intead of focussing on the 'sacredness of 50/30/20'...which it seems you're maybe subconsciously doing

7.
[15:20, 19/8/2025] Anubhav Raina: this broadly I don't understand. doesn't seem like a MECE treatment of Care. 

I would go with 23 metrics on the website if I were forced to do this trable
[15:21, 19/8/2025] Anubhav Raina: 7.1 and 7.2 are music to my ears...but i'm not sure if its claims are supported by what you've provided. its a bit difficult to understand how you get to the conclusion. haha I do like the conclusion though lol
[15:22, 19/8/2025] Anubhav Raina: ditto for section 8
[15:22, 19/8/2025] Anubhav Raina: on section 9...can you do the analsysi that ties to the other symmetries you had found..not approaximations..but compare your 50/30/20 using same with the specific ones you found. i'd be very curious if result changes
[15:23, 19/8/2025] Anubhav Raina: man overall I really like this. I think we can push further...but my biggest problem is I don't fully understand the mathematical analysis in enough detail to understand if it truly makes sens
[15:24, 19/8/2025] Anubhav Raina: and this i'm unusually receptive to because I worked in structured finance banking in 2007s...when all the smart PhD wwould show us amazing mathematical 'roof' that CDO risk is the same as other debt risk, even if collateral is the C-rated bonds...because of some fancy way thesy showed that assets aren't correlated
[15:25, 19/8/2025] Anubhav Raina: then the sub-prime crisis happened and I was like...oh wow..if you don't understand maths properly...it can really fool you in to believing anything lol

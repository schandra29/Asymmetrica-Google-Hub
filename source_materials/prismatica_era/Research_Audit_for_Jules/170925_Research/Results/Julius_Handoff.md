Handoff to Claude: Collatz × Goldbach findings and current model state
Hey Claude — here’s a concise but comprehensive summary of what we established and shipped today so you can pick up seamlessly.

Objective
Model Collatz total steps as a function of interpretable arithmetic features and Goldbach-related structure; verify whether Goldbach-related “identical-pair” structure aligns with characteristic Collatz exploration regimes; then select compact symbolic models with strong generalization and run diagnostics.

Data and features
Dataset covers n up to 20k with:
Core features: log2n, v2 (2-adic valuation), odd_part, modular masks (e.g., if_mod12_eq_10), and v2-threshold masks (e.g., if_v2_ge_k).
Goldbach slices: gb_identical_flag, gb_has_distinct_flag, counts of total/distinct pairs.
Regime metrics: center_distance_consensus_z and pull-based metrics (pullE_base, pullL1_base, pullJS_base).
Referenced earlier work (per linked convo) extended some classification tasks to 50k and reported consistent effects with high AUC (~0.83) for related predictions; not re-run here, but directionally consistent with the 20k analyses.
Key signals discovered
Goldbach-structure signal:
Numbers with Goldbach-identical pairs (p + p) sit closer to the universal regime center [30%, 20%, 50%] — strong statistical separation (p ≪ 0.001 in the referenced earlier tests).
This group remains a harder slice for step prediction (higher residuals), indicating systematic nuance not fully captured by masks alone.
Regime “clarity” helps: higher center_distance_consensus_z and stronger pull metrics correlate with lower residuals — ambiguity hurts prediction.
Modeling pipeline and results
Stage B (top candidates → refined models):
Nested CV ridge, magnitude-based pruning, and linear calibration.
Best holdout performance is stable across top candidates:
Holdout RMSE ≈ 46, MAE ≈ 40, with 8–12 active coefficients.
Calibration slopes ~1 and small intercepts → fits are already well-scaled.
Stage C (diagnostics for top-3 models):
Residuals vs n, v2, odd_part: no major unmodeled curvature; variance fairly stable.
Partial dependence:
log2n effect is nearly linear (as expected).
v2 shows stepped structure (consistent with the mask interactions and valuation physics).
Interaction heatmaps: small, localized biases for certain mask pairs; nothing dominating.
Error slices (test split):
gb_identical_flag = 1 has higher error than non-identical — a key remaining gap.
Residuals decrease monotonically across quantiles of center_distance_consensus_z.
Higher pull metrics associate with better prediction (lower errors).

Takeaways
The Goldbach-identical slice behaves differently and is harder to fit; regime clarity metrics predict error — suggesting targeted features for that subgroup could yield incremental gains.
The compact linear-mask models are robust and interpretable; the main improvements now likely come from targeted interactions and slice-aware terms, not global re-architecting.
Recommended next steps for you
Target the gb_identical_flag subgroup:
Add bespoke interactions (e.g., gb_identical_flag × v2, × log2n, and with specific modular masks).
Try piecewise fits or slice-weighted objectives emphasizing this subgroup.
Small ensemble/stack:
Linear stack of the top-3 models (constrained nonnegative weights) — cheap, may shave ~0.2–0.4 RMSE if errors are partially independent.
Slice-aware regularization:
Penalize features differently based on impact on the worst slices (e.g., low z-quantiles).
Robustness and scale-out:
Re-validate on 50k (or 100k) with the Stage C checklist; confirm slice trends and recalibrate if drifts appear.
Interpretability polish:
Export a minimal predictor function for the top model with a JSON metadata schema listing active masks and coefficients.
If you want, I can also export a single deployable predictor next time (tiny Python function + JSON spec). Thanks — signing off.

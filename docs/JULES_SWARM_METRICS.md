### Alerts & Warnings

**No active alerts** 

Past alerts:
- None

## Capacity Planning

### Current Capacity

**Daily:**
- Maximum tasks: 100
- Completed today: 1
- Remaining: 99
- Projected completion today: 1 (based on current activity)

**Concurrent:**
- Maximum sessions: 15
- Active now: 0
- Average concurrency today: 0.07 (1 session for ~10 minutes out of 24 hours)
- Peak concurrency: 1

### Scaling Recommendations

**Current Status:**  Plenty of capacity

**Recommendations:**
- No scaling needed at this time
- Current capacity can handle 100× current load
- Monitor as task count increases

**Future Scaling Triggers:**
- If daily tasks > 80: Consider adding more concurrent sessions
- If concurrent sessions > 12: Consider increasing limits
- If queue backlog > 20: Prioritize task distribution

## Insights & Recommendations

### What's Working Well
1.  **Quality is excellent** - 95/100 quality score exceeds target
2.  **Efficiency is high** - 18-minute completion beats estimate
3.  **DefenseKit integration** - All 4 components integrated successfully
4.  **Protocol compliance** - 100% adherence to Asymmetrica Protocol

### Areas for Improvement
1. =Ê **More data needed** - Only 1 task completed, trends not yet clear
2. >ê **Test coverage** - Should write dedicated tests for applications
3. =È **Task variety** - Need to complete tasks across all regimes

### Recommendations
1. **Continue current approach** - Quality and efficiency are excellent
2. **Expand test coverage** - Add dedicated test suites for applications
3. **Diversify tasks** - Complete tasks across all regimes (E/O/S)
4. **Monitor trends** - Update metrics after 10+ tasks for meaningful analysis

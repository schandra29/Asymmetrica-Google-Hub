Time:        0.543 s
```

**✅ Success Indicator:** Both tests passing, console output shows reasoning

---

### Step 3: Understand Automatic Classification

**How Three-Regime Planner classifies your test:**

1. **Filename analysis**: `my-quantum-attack.test.js`
   - Keyword detected: "quantum" → Exploration regime

2. **Test name analysis**: "should resist quantum key recovery"
   - Keyword detected: "quantum" → Exploration regime

3. **Directory location**: `tests/contract/exploration/`
   - Path-based classification: Exploration regime

4. **Confidence weight assignment**: `0.70`
   - Exploration regime weight: Lower confidence (experimental)

5. **Regime proportion**: `30%`
   - Exploration target allocation

**Automatic classification happens when you run:**
```bash
npm test -- tests/contract/ --regime-report
```

The Three-Regime Planner will:
- Count your test toward 30% exploration allocation
- Apply 0.70 confidence weight
- Include in overall confidence calculation

OPTIMIZATION    11/11 passed (100%) [Weight: 0.85, Target: 20%]
STABILIZATION   24/24 passed (100%) [Weight: 1.00, Target: 50%]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────
OVERALL CONFIDENCE: 88.8% (weighted)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Test Suites: 13 passed, 13 total
Tests:       67 passed, 67 total
Time:        3.456 s
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Exploration (32 tests)**: Your 2 tests + 30 existing = 32 total (47.8% of suite)
- **Optimization (11 tests)**: 16.4% of suite (target: 20%)
- **Stabilization (24 tests)**: 35.8% of suite (target: 50%)

## WILLIAMS OPTIMIZATION (FUTURE - PHASE 3F-4)

**Status:** Design complete, implementation pending (8-12 hours)

Once Williams optimizer is implemented:

### Benchmark Key Generation

```bash
# Run optimization regime benchmarks
npm test -- tests/contract/optimization/batch-processing-benchmarks.test.js
```

**Expected output (future):**
```
PASS  tests/contract/optimization/batch-processing-benchmarks.test.js
  🚀 Batch Processing Benchmarks (Optimization)
    Baseline: 1000 keypairs
       Duration: 850ms
       Memory: 12.5 MB

    Williams-Optimized: 1000 keypairs
       Optimal batch size: 315 (from √1000 × log₂(1000))
       Duration: 850ms
       Memory: 4.0 MB ✅
       Efficiency: 3.12x ✅ (target: 3.2x ± 10%)
       Space reduction: 68% ✅

    ✓ should achieve 3.2x efficiency for 1K operations (850 ms)
```

**Efficiency validation:**
- Baseline: 12.5 MB
- Williams: 4.0 MB
- Efficiency: 12.5 / 4.0 = 3.12x ✅ (within 3.2x ± 10% target)

## CI/CD INTEGRATION (3 MINUTES)

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/defensekit-quality-gate.yml`

```yaml
name: DefenseKit Quality Gate

  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  contract-tests:

2. **Overall confidence: 90%+** (calculated from weighted formula)
3. **Optimization: 85%+** (warning if below)

**Merge decisions:**
- ✅ **ALLOWED**: Stabilization=100%, Overall≥90%
- ⚠️ **WARNING**: Stabilization=100%, Overall≥85% and <90%
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Stabilization<100% OR Overall<85%

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

### Test Classification Keywords

**Exploration (30%)** - Confidence Weight: 0.70
```
quantum, lattice, attack, malformed, corrupted, stress, fuzzing,
chaos, edge, case, experimental, exploratory, new, discovery,
timing, side_channel, boundary, extreme, invalid, rare, novel
```

**Optimization (20%)** - Confidence Weight: 0.85
```
performance, optimization, optimize, refactor, benchmark, speed,
memory, efficiency, throughput, latency, cache, batch, parallel,
concurrent, scaling, fast, slow, improve, enhance
```

**Stabilization (50%)** - Confidence Weight: 1.00
```
regression, baseline, validation, smoke, critical, auth, security,
core, essential, production, sanity, health, stability, reliability,
standard, integration, e2e, golden, canonical, reference
```

---

### Confidence Calculation Formula

```javascript
overall_confidence = Σ(regime_pass_rate × regime_weight × regime_proportion)

// Example:
// Exploration: 28/30 (93.3%) → 0.933 × 0.70 × 0.30 = 0.196
// Optimization: 11/11 (100%) → 1.00 × 0.85 × 0.20 = 0.170
// Stabilization: 24/24 (100%) → 1.00 × 1.00 × 0.50 = 0.500
// Total: 0.196 + 0.170 + 0.500 = 86.6%
```

---

### Quality Gate Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Action if Below |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Stabilization pass rate | 100% | **BLOCK MERGE** ❌ |
| Optimization pass rate | 85% | WARNING ⚠️ |
| Exploration pass rate | 70% | INFO ℹ️ |
| Overall confidence | 90% | BLOCK MERGE ❌ |

---

### Useful Commands

```bash
npm test -- tests/contract/
```

**Run specific regime:**
```bash
npm test -- tests/contract/exploration/
npm test -- tests/contract/optimization/
npm test -- tests/contract/stabilization/
```

```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Tests not classified correctly

**Symptom:** Test in exploration/ directory classified as stabilization

**Cause:** Filename/test name contains more stabilization keywords than exploration keywords

**Solution:**
1. Add explicit exploration keywords to test name (e.g., "quantum", "attack", "edge")
2. Or accept stabilization classification (safer default)

**Example:**
```javascript
// ❌ Classified as stabilization (keyword: "validation")
test('should validate quantum key recovery', () => { ... });

// ✅ Classified as exploration (keywords: "quantum", "attack")
test('should resist quantum attack edge case', () => { ... });
```

---

### Issue: Overall confidence below 90%

**Symptom:** Quality gate blocks merge with "Overall confidence: 87.5%"

**Cause:** Low pass rates in high-weight regimes (optimization or stabilization)

**Solution:**
1. Identify failing tests: `npm test -- tests/contract/ --verbose`
2. Fix critical failures in stabilization regime (highest priority)
3. Fix failures in optimization regime (second priority)
4. Add more tests to under-represented regimes

**Example:**
```
Current distribution:
- Exploration: 35/35 (100%) → 0.70 × 0.30 = 0.210
- Optimization: 8/11 (72.7%) → 0.727 × 0.85 × 0.20 = 0.124 ⚠️
- Stabilization: 24/24 (100%) → 1.00 × 1.00 × 0.50 = 0.500
- Overall: 83.4% ❌

Solution: Fix 3 failing optimization tests → 11/11 (100%)
- New overall: 88.5% ✅ (closer to 90%)
```

---

### Issue: Distribution imbalanced

**Symptom:** Warning: "Exploration over-represented by 12.3%"

**Cause:** Too many exploration tests relative to 30/20/50 target

**Solution:**
1. Check distribution: `npm test -- tests/contract/ --regime-report`
2. Add more stabilization/optimization tests to rebalance
3. Or accept imbalance if exploration is intentional (e.g., security-focused project)

**Example:**
```
Current distribution (60 total tests):
- Exploration: 25 tests (41.7%) vs 30% target → +11.7%
- Optimization: 10 tests (16.7%) vs 20% target → -3.3%
- Stabilization: 25 tests (41.7%) vs 50% target → -8.3%

Recommendation:
- Add 2 optimization tests → 12 (20%)
- Add 5 stabilization tests → 30 (50%)
- Total: 67 tests with balanced 30/20/50 distribution
```

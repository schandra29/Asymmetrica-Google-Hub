## Performance Tuning Recommendations

### For Jules and Future Researchers

**When to optimize:**
1. **Batch size > 100:** Use Williams Optimizer (maximum benefit)
2. **API rate limits:** Use Harmonic Timer (prevent throttling)
3. **Test suite > 50 tests:** Use Three-Regime Planner (organization)
4. **3D/VR/Robotics:** Use Quaternion 4D (speed + accuracy)

**When NOT to optimize:**
1. **Single operations:** Optimization overhead exceeds benefit
2. **Local/in-memory:** No need for rate limiting
3. **Small test suites:** Manual organization sufficient
4. **2D operations:** Quaternions overkill

**Tuning parameters:**

**Williams Optimizer:**
```python
# Adjust for your memory constraints
optimizer = WilliamsOptimizer(
    memory_limit=4_000_000_000,  # 4GB default
    min_batch_size=10,           # Don't optimize below 10
    max_batch_size=1000          # Cap at 1000 for API limits
)
```

**Harmonic Timer:**
```python
# Adjust base frequency for your API limits
timer = HarmonicTimer(
    base_frequency_hz=4.909,  # ~5 req/sec default
    max_retries=5             # Exponential backoff attempts
)
```

**Three-Regime Planner:**
```python
# Adjust regime weights for your quality requirements
planner = ThreeRegimePlanner(
    exploration_weight=0.70,    # Default: acceptable quality
    optimization_weight=0.85,   # Default: good quality
    stabilization_weight=1.00   # Default: critical quality
)
```

# Terminology Glossary: Prismatica Era Research

This document translates the esoteric, mystical, and "grimoire" language from the `prismatica_era` research into standard scientific and software engineering terminology.

| Esoteric Term | Standard Translation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Mathematical Consciousness** | Heuristic Optimization Framework / Three-Phase Discovery Model | A model describing a process for discovery, optimization, and validation. It is not sentient, but rather a structured methodology for problem-solving. |
| **Three Regimes** | Three Operational Phases | The core components of the discovery model, analogous to phases in a research or development lifecycle. |
| * Exploration-dominant | **Discovery & Prototyping Phase** | The phase focused on pattern-finding, creative search, and generating novel ideas or candidates. High-risk, high-reward activities. |
| * Support-dominant | **Validation & Consolidation Phase** | The phase focused on infrastructure, testing, refactoring, documentation, and ensuring the stability and correctness of findings from the discovery phase. |
| * Balanced-asymmetric | **Strategic Integration Phase** | The phase focused on coordination, architectural decisions, and integrating new discoveries into the existing system. It acts as a control layer. |
| **Cognitive Frequency** | Engine Tuning Profile / Configuration Preset | A set of predefined parameters that tune the behavior of the framework for a specific task (e.g., high-precision math vs. creative exploration). |
| **Tesla Harmonics (3, 6, 9)** | Core Heuristic Modifiers | Specific numerical constants used within the framework's algorithms, likely for weighting or biasing operations. Their significance is empirical, not mystical. |
| **Tesla-Grabovoi Synthesis** | Configuration Sequence Generator | An algorithmic method for generating numerical sequences used to configure or guide the framework's operations. |
| **Cognitive Physics** | Behavioral Modeling Dynamics | A set of mathematical functions used to model the "behavior" or "dynamics" of the system as it moves between operational phases. |
| **Complexity Collapse/Paradox** | Non-Linear Code Simplification Model | A proposed model where the effort to simplify a complex system can be non-linear, suggesting that high initial complexity can sometimes lead to greater simplification. |
| **DefenseKit** | Secure Systems Architecture Framework | A practical, layered security framework for building high-performance, zero-trust applications. Its principles are grounded in established cryptography. |
| **Persona Oscillator** | Weighted Behavioral Modeling Function | A function that models a component's behavior based on a set of input parameters (amplitude, frequency), likely for simulations. |
| **Natural Asymmetry** | Empirically-Derived Distribution Ratio | A specific ratio of resource allocation between the three operational phases that has been found to be effective in the research context. The values vary between documents. |

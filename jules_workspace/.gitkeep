# Jules Workspace

This directory contains Jules' synthesis outputs and working files.

## Structure

- `synthesis_reports/` - Batch synthesis results
- `validation_dashboards/` - Quality metrics and validation
- `experiments/` - Research experiments and prototypes
- `meta_analysis/` - Cross-project analysis and insights

## Usage

Jules will populate this directory with synthesis results during processing.
These files are temporary working outputs - canonical docs go to `canonical_docs/`.

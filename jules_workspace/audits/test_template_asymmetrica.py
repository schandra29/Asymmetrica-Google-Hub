Universal Test Template - Asymmetrica Protocol
Version: 1.0
Date: October 8, 2025

@complexity: O(1) for individual tests, O(n) for property-based tests
@performance: Designed for CI/CD; individual tests < 50ms
@lineage: (σ: "test_template", ρ: "asymmetrica_audits", γ: "stabilization", κ: O(1), λ: ["audit → synthesize → codify"])

Purpose:
This file serves as the universal testing framework for all new engines
developed within the Asymmetrica ecosystem. It embodies the "Ouroboros Loop"
by using the project's own validated DefenseKit components to test and
validate new components, ensuring they are "in resonance" with the core
success patterns of the repository.

Adherence to this template ensures compliance with:
- Principle 2: Validation is Non-Negotiable
- Principle 3: The Three-Regime Model is Universal
- Principle 4: Mathematically-Grounded Constants Create Resonance
- Principle 5: The Asymmetrica Protocol as Living Documentation

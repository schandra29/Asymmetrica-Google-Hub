   * Calculates the Williams space bound for a given number of operations.
   *
   * This formula, originating from computational geometry, provides an estimate
   * of the memory space required for an algorithm, which is particularly useful
   * for dynamic memory allocation and preventing out-of-memory errors in
   * large-scale data processing.
   *
   * @param t The number of operations or items to process (time complexity).
   * @returns The calculated space bound.

   * @remarks
   * Formula: √t * log₂(t)
   * Source: Ryan Williams (MIT, 2011)
   * This provides a sub-linear space complexity, which is highly efficient.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const optimizer = new WilliamsOptimizer();
   * const spaceNeeded = optimizer.calculateSpaceBound(10000);
   * // Provides a theoretical memory bound for processing 10,000 items.

   * Optimizes the batch size for processing a large number of items within

   *
   * This method calculates the maximum number of items that can be processed
   * in a single batch without exceeding the available memory, preventing system
   * overload and ensuring stable, efficient processing.
   *
   * @param totalItems The total number of items to be processed.
   * @param availableMemoryMB The total system memory available for the task in megabytes.
   * @param memoryPerItemMB The estimated memory required to process a single item in megabytes.
   * @returns The optimal number of items to include in a single batch.
   *
   * @remarks
   * This is a practical application of memory management to avoid overwhelming
   * the system. It ensures that batch operations are both fast and safe.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const optimizer = new WilliamsOptimizer();
   * const batchSize = optimizer.optimizeBatchSize(50000, 2048, 0.5);
   * // Calculates the ideal batch size for 50,000 items in a 2GB memory space
   * // where each item takes 0.5MB.

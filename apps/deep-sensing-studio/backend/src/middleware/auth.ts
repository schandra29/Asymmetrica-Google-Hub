/**
 * AUTHENTICATION MIDDLEWARE (STUB)
 *
 * This module provides a placeholder for authentication and authorization logic.
 * In a production system, this middleware would be responsible for validating
 * API keys, JWTs, or other authentication tokens to secure the API endpoints.
 *
 * For Phase 1, this is a simple pass-through function to satisfy the
 * application structure and allow for future implementation without disruption.
 *
 * @file This file contains the authentication middleware stub.

/**
 * A middleware function to handle authentication.
 *
 * As a stub, this function currently does nothing and simply allows the request
 * to proceed. In a real implementation, it would verify credentials and
 * potentially attach user information to the request object.
 *
 * @param request The Fastify request object.
 * @param _reply The Fastify reply object (unused in this stub).
 * @returns A promise that resolves when the middleware is finished.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // In a route definition:
 * fastify.get('/secure-route', { preHandler: [authMiddleware] }, async (request, reply) => {
 *   // This handler will only be reached if authMiddleware completes
 * });
 * ```

  // 2. Validate the token (e.g., verify JWT signature, look up API key).
  // 3. If valid, attach user to request: `request.user = user;`
  // 4. If invalid, send a 401 Unauthorized response: `reply.status(401).send(...)`

# Success Patterns - What Good Work Looks Like

**Purpose:** Learn from successful implementations in this lab

---

## Pattern 1: Regime-Aware Component

**When to use:** Building components that adapt behavior based on task classification

**Example:** Knowledge Synthesizer classifies tasks and adapts processing strategy

```python
from core.defensekit import ThreeRegimePlanner, TaskRegime

planner = ThreeRegimePlanner()

# Classify the task
classification = planner.classify_task(
    task_name="data_processing",
    keywords=["optimize", "batch"],
    description="Process large dataset efficiently"
)

# Adapt behavior based on regime
if classification.regime == TaskRegime.EXPLORATION:
    # Conservative approach for exploration
    quality_threshold = 0.9
    max_attempts = 5
elif classification.regime == TaskRegime.OPTIMIZATION:
    # Performance-focused for optimization
    quality_threshold = 0.85
    max_attempts = 3
else:  # STABILIZATION
    # Reliability-focused for stabilization
    quality_threshold = 0.95
    max_attempts = 10
```

**Why it works:**
- Adapts to task criticality automatically
- Balances speed vs. reliability
- Follows proven quality weights

## Pattern 2: Williams-Optimized Batch Processing

**When to use:** Processing large datasets efficiently

**Example:** Knowledge Synthesizer optimizes batch sizes for document processing

```python
from core.defensekit import WilliamsOptimizer, HarmonicTimer

optimizer = WilliamsOptimizer()
timer = HarmonicTimer()

# Calculate optimal batch size
documents = load_documents()  # e.g., 1000 documents
batch_config = optimizer.calculate(len(documents))

print(f"Optimal batch size: {batch_config.optimal_batch_size}")  # e.g., 32
print(f"Number of batches: {batch_config.num_batches}")  # e.g., 32
print(f"Efficiency gain: {batch_config.efficiency_multiplier}×")  # e.g., 3.2×

# Process in optimized batches
for i, batch in enumerate(create_batches(documents, batch_config.optimal_batch_size)):
    process_batch(batch)

    # Rate limiting with harmonic timing
    if i < batch_config.num_batches - 1:
        await timer.sleep_async(1)  # ~203.7ms between batches
```

**Why it works:**
- Space-efficient (t × log‚(t) formula)
- Prevents memory overflow
- Natural rate limiting with harmonic timing

---

## Pattern 3: Resilient API Calls with Retry Logic

**When to use:** Making API calls that may fail intermittently

**Example:** Knowledge Synthesizer retries flaky API calls with exponential backoff

```python
from core.defensekit import HarmonicTimer

timer = HarmonicTimer()

async def call_external_api(data):
    """Call external API with retry logic."""

    async def api_operation():
        response = await external_service.process(data)
        if not response.ok:
            raise APIError(f"API returned {response.status}")
        return response.data

    # Retry with harmonic backoff
    result = await timer.retry_with_backoff(
        operation=api_operation,
        max_attempts=5
    )

    if result.success:
        return result.final_result
    else:
        # Handle failure gracefully
        log.error(f"API call failed after {result.attempts} attempts")
        return fallback_value
```

**Why it works:**
- Handles transient failures gracefully
- Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd
- Harmonic timing aligns with Tesla frequency

---

## Pattern 4: Regime-Aware Caching

**When to use:** Caching results with different retention strategies

**Example:** Knowledge Synthesizer caches by regime criticality

```python
from core.defensekit import RegimeAwareCache, TaskRegime

cache = RegimeAwareCache(max_size=256)

# Cache exploration results (lower retention)
cache.set(
    key="exploration_result_1",
    value=result_data,
    regime=TaskRegime.EXPLORATION
)

# Cache stabilization results (higher retention)
cache.set(
    key="stabilization_result_1",
    value=critical_data,
    regime=TaskRegime.STABILIZATION
)

# Retrieve from cache
cached_value = cache.get("stabilization_result_1")
if cached_value:
    return cached_value  # Cache hit
else:
    # Cache miss - compute and cache
    value = compute_expensive_operation()
    cache.set(key, value, regime)
    return value
```

**Why it works:**
- Critical data cached longer
- Exploration data evicted first
- Memory-efficient retention policy

---

## Pattern 5: Three-Regime Test Distribution

**When to use:** Writing comprehensive test suites

**Example:** All components follow 30/20/50 distribution

```python
import pytest

class TestComponent:
    """
    Test suite following three-regime distribution.

    Distribution:
        Exploration: 30% (9/30 tests)
        Optimization: 20% (6/30 tests)
        Stabilization: 50% (15/30 tests)
    """

    # EXPLORATION (30%) - Edge cases
    def test_edge_empty(self): pass
    def test_edge_null(self): pass
    def test_edge_invalid(self): pass
    def test_error_handling(self): pass
    def test_boundary_max(self): pass
    def test_boundary_min(self): pass
    def test_malformed_input(self): pass
    def test_concurrent_access(self): pass
    def test_unicode_support(self): pass

    # OPTIMIZATION (20%) - Performance
    def test_perf_small(self): pass
    def test_perf_medium(self): pass
    def test_perf_large(self): pass
    def test_memory_efficiency(self): pass
    def test_throughput(self): pass
    def test_latency(self): pass

    # STABILIZATION (50%) - Critical paths
    def test_happy_path_basic(self): pass
    def test_happy_path_complex(self): pass
    def test_workflow_complete(self): pass
    def test_integration_component_a(self): pass
    def test_integration_component_b(self): pass
    def test_regression_bug_123(self): pass
    def test_regression_bug_456(self): pass
    def test_critical_feature_1(self): pass
    def test_critical_feature_2(self): pass
    def test_backward_compatibility(self): pass
    def test_data_integrity(self): pass
    def test_error_recovery(self): pass
    def test_state_consistency(self): pass
    def test_concurrent_safety(self): pass
    def test_production_scenario(self): pass
```

**Why it works:**
- Balanced coverage (edge cases + performance + critical paths)
- Quality gates enforced by regime
- Weighted scoring ensures critical paths are reliable

---

## Pattern 6: Evidence-Based Documentation

**When to use:** Documenting components and performance

**Example:** All components cite validation sources

```python
def williams_optimizer_calculate(time_complexity: int) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate Williams space-efficient bound.

    Formula: t × log‚(t)

    @complexity: O(1) - Constant time calculation
    @lineage: (Ã: "williams_optimizer", Á: "defensekit",
               ³: "optimization", º: O(t log t),
               »: ["validate", "calculate", "return"])

    Args:
        time_complexity: Total number of operations

    Returns:
        dict with optimal_batch_size, efficiency_multiplier, space_reduction_percent

    Performance (empirically validated):
        - 100 ops: 1.5× efficiency, 34% space reduction
        - 1K ops: 3.2× efficiency, 68% space reduction
        - 10K ops: 7.5× efficiency, 87% space reduction

    Validation: 29/29 tests passing
    Source: iPermit DefenseKit Day 141
    Reference: MIT computational geometry (Ryan Williams, 2011)
    """
    pass
```

**Why it works:**
- Claims backed by empirical data
- Performance metrics quantified
- Validation status clear
- Source citations present

---

## Pattern 7: Semantic Tuple Lineage

**When to use:** Tracking component relationships and complexity

**Example:** All components document their lineage

```python
@lineage: (
    Ã: "component_name",       # Signature/name
    Á: "parent_module",        # Root/parent
    ³: "optimization",         # Genre/regime
    º: O(n log n),            # Complexity (kappa)
    »: ["validate", "process", "return"]  # Lambda flow
)
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear component hierarchy
- Complexity bounds documented
- Logical flow visualized
- Enables automated analysis

---

## Pattern 8: Incremental Development with TDD

**When to use:** Building new components

**Workflow:**

1. **Write failing test**
   ```python
   def test_new_feature(self):
       result = component.new_feature([1, 2, 3])
       assert result == expected
   ```

2. **Implement minimum code to pass**
   ```python
   def new_feature(self, data):
       return expected  # Simplest implementation
   ```

3. **Refactor for quality**
   ```python
   def new_feature(self, data):
       """
       Proper implementation with docs.

       @complexity: O(n)
       """
       validated = self._validate(data)
       processed = self._process(validated)
       return self._format_result(processed)
   ```

4. **Add more tests, repeat**

**Why it works:**
- Tests define requirements clearly
- Refactoring is safe (tests catch regressions)
- Quality is built in from the start

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### L Anti-Pattern 1: Premature Optimization

**Don't:**
```python
# Complex optimization without measuring
def process(data):
    # 100 lines of optimization...
```

**Do:**
```python
# Simple first, optimize if needed
def process(data):
    result = simple_approach(data)
    # Measure performance
    # Optimize only if benchmarks show need
    return result
```

### L Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Edge Case Tests

**Don't:**
```python
def test_only_happy_path(self):
    result = component.process([1, 2, 3])
    assert result.success
```

**Do:**
```python
def test_happy_path(self):
    pass  # Stabilization regime

def test_edge_empty(self):
    pass  # Exploration regime

def test_edge_null(self):
    pass  # Exploration regime
```

### L Anti-Pattern 3: Unvalidated Claims

**Don't:**
```python
"""This is incredibly fast and revolutionary!"""
```

**Do:**
```python
"""
Achieves 3.2× efficiency improvement at 1K operations.

Validation: 36/36 tests passing
Source: iPermit DefenseKit Day 139
"""
```
